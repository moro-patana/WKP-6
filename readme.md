# Report:
## In my html:
 * I only have a form with two checkboxes and an article nothing inside.

## In script:
   
   1. First of all, I grabed the elements which I will use.

   2. Used map to generate the food array object and created an html.

   3. Push the html to the DOM.

   4. I created the order card for the customers' choices and insert it into the DOM as well.

   5. Add event listener to the checkboxes:

     * put condition if the checkboxes are checked and we only have spicy food or vegetarian food.

	 * created an html for each type of food (vegetarian or spicy).

   6. I created a modal as a message from the restaurant for the customer:
		***Thanking***, 
		***Asking for patient***,
		***The total cost***

**NB**: If i had more time, I would work on the customer order card and made my checboxes work propery.

## Lesson:

In this project, I learnt that map() works as a loop and what is surprising me is that we can add event listener to the checkbox.

## Difficult part:

I could not finish the order part i mean the customers card.

## Help:

Do you mind giving me more explanation how differenciate:

**element.innerHTML += ""; and element.innerHTML = "";**

## Summary

In general, I love solving a difficult topisc like this so that i learn new thing later. Thank you for giving us new project every weekend!!
